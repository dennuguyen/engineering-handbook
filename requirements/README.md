# Requirements

Requirements are descriptions of a solution of the problem that hasn't been solved yet.

## User Needs

Fundamental to requirements are user needs. All requirements will stem from a set of user needs.

### User Stories

User needs can be formatted as user stories:

```
As a [user], I want to [need], so that I can [context].
```

<details><summary>Example</summary><p>

A set of user stories based on the user problem: *Urban environments are too hot*.

- As a building resident, I want to reduce the cost of my AC use, so that I can be financially comfortable.
- As a building resident, I want to not add any extra steps to my daily routine, so that I can spend less daily energy.
- As a building resident, I want to stay cool during the summer, so that I can be physically comfortable.

### Nouns

User needs can be formatted as nouns.

A set of nouns based on the user problem: *Urban environments are too hot*.

- Cost.
- Comfort.
- Cooling.

</p></details>

<details><summary>Opinion</summary><p>

I would avoid this format as it loses a lot of context of the user's requirements.

## Types of Requirements

There are various types of requirements e.g.:
- **Functional**: What functions/capabilities the solution should have?
- **Constraint**: What the solution should not do?
- **Interface**: How the solution interacts with other systems (internally or externally)?
- **Physical**: What physical properties should the solution have?
- **Performance**: How well should the solution accomplish a function under specific conditions?

> Using the appropriate type of requirement may help the engineer think about how to use the requirement in the solution.

> There are many more types of requirements!

## Writing Requirements

Writing good requirements allows the development of a good solution. SMART goals could be used as a model for a good requirement:
- **Specific**: The requirement should be precise and singular.
- **Measurable**: The rqeuirement should have a metric to indicate when it has been achieved.
- **Attainable**: The requirement should be realistic to the scope of the project (triple-constraint theory).
- **Relevant**: The requirement should be relevant to the problem statement and user needs.

## Verifying Requirements

A method for verifying requirements should be considered when writing requirements.
